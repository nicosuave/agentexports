Open up your search to be looser (somethingmight not be named as you expect).

Work isn't done until tests pass.\n\n## Git & PRs\n- Commit and push from host machine, not inside docker\n- Never change global git configs\n- Keep branch names simple (no prefixes)\n- No \"Test plan\" header in PR descriptions\n- No emojis in commits or PRs\n- Run CI checks (tests, lint, format) before committing\n- Prefer `docker compose` over `docker-compose`\n- NEVER commit until explicitly asked or until you're certain work is complete. If unsure, ask \"ready to commit?\"\n\n## File Management\n- Use the Edit tool, not sed (you mess up sed and burn tokens)\n- No v2/bak files; use git commits to capture state\n- Roll forward, don't create backup copies\n\n# Python with uv\n\nAlways use `uv run`, never `python` or `python3`.\n\n```bash\nuv add <package>        # install\nuv remove <package>     # remove\nuv sync                 # sync lockfile\nuv run script.py        # run script\nuv run pytest           # run tools\nuv run python           # repl\n```\n\nPrefer PEP 723 inline metadata for scripts:\n```bash\nuv add package --script script.py\nuv remove package --script script.py\n```\n\n# Data Work\n\n- Use DuckDB for csv, parquet, json processing\n- SQL style: CTEs over subqueries, lowercase keywords\n- Ask for schema clarification or introspect tables yourself\n- Jupyter with jupysql for exploration\n\n# Project Organization\n\nUse CLAUDE.md files as scoped persistent memory. Add/update them when:\n- You discover important context\n- I correct you on something\n- You establish new patterns\n- You hit limitations after going back and forth\n\nProject scratchpad directories:\n- `./docs` for planning, strategy, and tactics\n- `./scripts` for scripts (unless project has existing convention)\n\nRead existing content before adding new.\n\n# Context Management\n\nWhen compacting: preserve detailed context for in-progress work; consider this a handoff for another LLM. Leave extensive notes for anything interrupted. You likely do NOT need the entire list of user messages and it's probably more helpful to provide a little more detail.\n\nDo not randomly check background task output after compacting unless directly relevant.\n\n# Agents\n\nWhen calling on agents, please *alwyays* prefer Opus agent to Explore\n\n# Secrets\n\nIf you create secrets, ensure they get stored properly (secret store preferred). If no store available, explicitly tell me to save them.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- memex-search: Search, filter, and retrieve Claude/Codex history indexed by memex. Use when the user wants to search their conversation history, find past sessions, retrieve transcripts, or look up what was discussed previously. (file: /Users/nico/.codex/skills/memex-search/SKILL.md)\n- oracle: Use the @steipete/oracle CLI to bundle a prompt plus the right files and get a second-model review (API or browser) for debugging, refactors, design checks, or cross-validation. (file: /Users/nico/.codex/skills/oracle/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nico/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nico/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai"}}
